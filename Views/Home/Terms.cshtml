        Submissions"), such User Submissions are subject
        to our <a asp-action="Privacy">Privacy Policy</a>

        the extent such you have the ability to post a User Submission publicly on the
        Website, you expressly grant the Foundation a nonexclusive, perpetual,
        irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up worldwide, fully sublicensable right

        civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. Such violations may subject the
        sender and the sender's agents to civil and criminal penalties. The Foundation
        may reject any submissions or postings in which the Foundation believes, in its
        sole discretion, that any such activities have occurred. If notified by a user
